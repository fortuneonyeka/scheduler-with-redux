# Event Scheduling application.
"The Event Shedular project is a simple calendar application built using React, React-Redux and the react-big-calendar library. This project allows users to view and manage events within a calendar interface.

Features
Event Management: Users can add, edit, and delete events directly within the calendar interface.
Date Selection: Supports selection of dates and time slots for creating new events.
Event Styling: Events are styled differently based on their start dates, with past events displayed with a strikethrough style.
Local Storage: Events are persisted using the browser's local storage, ensuring that user data is retained between sessions.
Technologies Used
React: The project is built using the React JavaScript library, allowing for efficient and scalable UI development.
react-big-calendar: This library provides the core calendar functionality, including event rendering, date selection, and view customization.
Moment.js: Used for date and time manipulation, allowing for easy handling of dates and time zones.
CSS Styling: Custom styling is applied to the calendar interface using CSS files.
Usage
Viewing Events: Users can view existing events within the calendar interface. Events are displayed with different styling based on their start dates.
Adding Events: Users can click on available time slots to add new events. Only dates in the present or future are selectable for event creation.
Editing Events: Clicking on an existing event opens a modal window, allowing users to edit event details such as the title and date.
Deleting Events: Events can be deleted by clicking on the delete button within the event modal window.
